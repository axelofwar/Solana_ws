# solana_ws
This is a workspace to contain my tests of on the solana blockchain. Currently this comprises of getting nft metadata from a wallet address and subsequent
token address in typescript, using javascript, c++, and rust to interact with solana, and a anchor program example.

As I learn more about what I'm doing and am less involved in other concurrent projects I'll make this description more robust
